You are my Lead Web3 Protocol Engineer. I have seeded this repository with a v3-reference folder and an updated TASKS.md file containing our migration plan to ERC-7579.

Your directive: Open and read TASKS.md. You are strictly bound by its Global Directives. Do not skip steps. Execute Phase 0 right now. Do not stop at the checkpoints. When you finish a phase, summarize your work, commit the code, and immediately proceed to the next phase until all 6 phases are complete. Let's build.
