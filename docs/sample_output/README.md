## Files

| File | Script | What It Proves |
|---|---|---|
| [forge_tests.txt](forge_tests.txt) | `forge test -vv` | 21 Solidity tests passing (18 AegisModule + 3 templates) |
| [jest_tests.txt](jest_tests.txt) | `npx jest` | 83 TypeScript tests passing across 7 suites |
| [demo_v5_setup_run.txt](demo_v5_setup_run.txt) | `demo_v5_setup.ps1` | Infrastructure boot: Base Sepolia ✅, Docker ✅, WASM ✅ |
| [demo_v5_master_run.txt](demo_v5_master_run.txt) | `demo_v5_master.ps1` | Full 7-act lifecycle: subscribe → audit → CRE AI → swap/revert → budget → kill switch |
| [demo_v5_cre_run.txt](demo_v5_cre_run.txt) | `demo_v5_cre.ps1` | Raw CRE WASM execution with GPT-4o + Llama-3 consensus |
| [demo_v5_heimdall_run.txt](demo_v5_heimdall_run.txt) | `demo_v5_heimdall.ps1` | **Heimdall pipeline:** eth_getCode → bytecode decompilation → GPT-4o risk analysis on unverified contracts |
| [erc4337_userop_run.txt](erc4337_userop_run.txt) | `v5_e2e_mock.ts` | **ERC-4337 proof:** Safe deploy → Pimlico UserOp → triggerSwap via Account Abstraction |
| [session_validator_install.txt](session_validator_install.txt) | `v5_install_session_validator.ts` | **ERC-7715 proof:** Safe 7579 deploy → SmartSessionValidator installed → agent subscribed |

## Key Highlights in `demo_v5_master_run.txt`

- **Act 2**: `subscribeAgent(NOVA, 0.05 ETH)` + `subscribeAgent(CIPHER, 0.008 ETH)` — real on-chain txs
- **Act 4**: Live CRE WASM execution — GoPlus detects honeypot, GPT-4o + Llama-3 both flag `privilegeEscalation: true`
- **Act 5**: MockBRETT swap ✅ SUCCESS, MockHoneypot swap ❌ `TokenNotCleared()` REVERT
- **Act 6**: `agentAllowances()` proves budget was deducted on-chain
- **Act 7**: `revokeAgent(REX)` — budget zeroed, access denied
